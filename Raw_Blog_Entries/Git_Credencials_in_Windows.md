# Git Credencials in Windows
I was in my last days at Flex-N-Gate when I was updating my Job Applications repo (or one of the other ones), and I had to switch to a different GitHub profile to upload the new information to a repository. I tried to use the `git user.name` change (since I did not want it to be global) but that did not seem to work. One of the posts i read **need citation here** talked about the *Windows Credential Manager.* So when I looked into the Credential Manager i found that there was one credential called `git@github.com` with the username of `Personal Identification Token`. When I deleted that I was finally prompted for a login to GitHub when I tried to push. I did the `Add` `Commit` `Push` cycle a few times and then it was time to change back to my default work GitHub profile. Low and behold I had a new `git@github` token. The new one was for the home use GitHub. I had to delete that one to get back to the Work one. 

a few notes. I do not rememver setting this up (although it could have been in Git For Windows)

the fix is to have Credential Manager open and just refresh the page, then delete the new `git@github.com` and then try to push again.
